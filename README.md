## 💻 Turning energy drink 🔋 into full-stack magic — driving the future of automotive tech

By day, I’m building next-gen software for the automotive industry — shaping digital workflows and data systems that keep vehicles and documentation in motion.
By night, I craft sleek web apps with TypeScript, Next.js, React, and Prisma on PostgreSQL — all styled with Tailwind and shipped in Docker containers 🐳.
Always vibing between intuitive UX & creative chaos ⚡✨
